# WealthDistributionStimulator

The Wealth Distribution Stimulator is a Java implementation of a wealth distribution model in NetLogo. It provides a simulation of wealth distribution dynamics based on various parameters and rules. This README file aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the simulator, including its features, installation instructions, usage guide, and additional resources.

## Features

The Wealth Distribution Stimulator offers the following features:

1. **Agent-based simulation:** The simulator employs an agent-based modeling approach, where individual agents interact with each other based on predefined rules to simulate wealth distribution dynamics.

2. **Wealth distribution dynamics:** The model simulates the dynamics of wealth distribution by representing agents as entities possessing varying levels of wealth. The wealth distribution evolves over time based on agent interactions and transactions.

3. **Parameter customization:** Users can customize various parameters of the model, including the number of agents, initial wealth distribution, wealth transfer rules, and transaction mechanisms, to observe the effects on wealth distribution patterns.

4. **Statistical analysis:** The model includes statistical analysis tools to calculate and visualize key wealth distribution metrics, such as Gini coefficient, Lorenz curve, and wealth quantiles.

## How to Run the Model

To run the Wealth Distribution Stimulator, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Code` folder.

   ```
   cd Code
   ```

2. Compile the Java files.

   ```
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Execute the `Main` class.

   ```
   java Main
   ```

   This will start the simulation, and the wealth distribution model will run with the default parameters.

4. If you prefer using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to run the model, open the `Code` folder as the project folder in your IDE and run the `Main.java` file.

## How to Modify the Parameters

To modify the parameters of the model, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Code` folder.

   ```
   cd Code
   ```

2. Open the `Params.java` file in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. Within the `Params` class, locate the variables representing the parameters you want to modify.

4. Modify the values of the desired parameters according to your requirements.

5. Save the `Params.java` file.

When you run the model again, it will use the updated parameter values you specified.

## Other Folders

The Wealth Distribution Stimulator repository includes the following additional folders:

- `scripts`: This folder contains Python scripts used to generate graphs and visualizations that were included in our report. These scripts utilize the output data generated by the model.

- `output`: This folder stores the output of our model. It may include files or data produced during the simulation process.
